# Background-Color-Changer
This is a simple JavaScript project that changes the background color of the webpage every second when the Start button is clicked, and stops when the Stop button is clicked.
It uses:
setInterval() to create a timed color change
Random RGB values (with a dark color range)
DOM manipulation and basic event handling
Start/Stop background color animation using disabled buttons to avoid duplicate intervals
